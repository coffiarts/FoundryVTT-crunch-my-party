## What it does ...
Are you a game master who frequently needs to control a hole bunch of scene actors at once?
- Maybe you like remote controlling your players' tokens while they're travelling through a dungeon in between encounters?
- Or you need to handle larger groups of foes?

Then you might know the tediousness of having to micromanage all those tokens... aaaargh! It simply ends up in stressful slapstick, breaking your game flow.

This module of mine is meant as a comfortable solution to it:
Easily collapse arbitrary groups of scene tokens (representing parties) into an easy-to-use single "party token", and vice versa. Manage up to 5 separate parties with up to 25 members each!

## Changelog
Has been moved to [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)

## How it works ...
At first, before experimenting by yourself, please have a look at the [Video demo on youtube](https://youtu.be/ix66vZ8A0OI)

The main functions, briefly explained:

### GROUP - Define a new party
1. Create a custom token representing your party in "crunched" state
2. Add that party token to the scene and disable it (remember its name in correct spelling)
3. Select any tokens in the scene that should join your party
4. Run the related "Group Party #x" macro (see section [Control it by macro](#control-it-by-macro))
5. Enter the name of the party token from step 1.

=> You're done. Your party is defined! HURRAY!!

### TOGGLE - CRUNCH an exploded party into one single party token
1. Optional: If you want to control exactly where the party token should appear, select one (exactly ONE!) of your member tokens as the target.
2. Run the related "Toggle Party #x" macro (see section [Control it by macro](#control-it-by-macro))

That's it: 

- Your party members will be automatically rendered invisible and moved (secretly) out of the way to the top-left corner of your scene
- Your predefined / preassigned party token will be moved from its "hiding place" in the top left corner to the previous location of your members and rendered visible.
- If you should have selected ONE member in step 1., this will be the position of the party token. Otherwise, the party token will appear at the location of one arbitrary member.

### TOGGLE - EXPLODE a collapsed party into separate member tokens
1. Run the related "Toggle Party #x" macro (see section [Control it by macro](#control-it-by-macro))

That's it:

- Your single party token will be automatically rendered invisible and moved (secretly) out of the way to the top-left corner of your scene
- The related member tokens will be moved from their "hiding place" in the top left corner to the previous location of your party token and rendered visible.

### FIND - Jump to an already defined party in the scene
1. Run the related "Find Party #x" macro (see section [Control it by macro](#control-it-by-macro))

That's it. Your canvas view moves automatically to the scene location of that party and automatically selects its tokens (be it in crunched or exploded state).


## Known restrictions
- Token names may not (currently) have ***commas*** (comma is used as delimiter for the token names list stored in user prefs). If many people should comply about it, I'll try to make the delimiter char configurable (see [Upcoming features](#upcoming-features))
- The "EXPLODE" animation of large groups appears somewhat clumsy and slow. That is known and by design. I had to build in a 200 msec timeout between every two tokens, to improve stability (no better solution found yet). If you are eager to contribute, have a look at the [related disussion on Discord](https://discord.com/channels/170995199584108546/722559135371231352/1080590427012485211)

## Find and toggle by hotkeys
You (gamemasters only) can assign custom hotkeys for finding and toggling groups in the game settings (by default it is empty to prevent unwanted key collisions). My personal preference is **SHIFT + 1/2/3/4/5** for finding and **CTRL + SHIFT + 1/2/3/4/5** for toggling.

<img src="src/crunch-my-party/artwork/crunch-my-party-keybinding-step2.png" alt="Crunch My Party! assign keybinding - step 2"/>

<img src="src/crunch-my-party/artwork/crunch-my-party-keybinding-step3.png" alt="Crunch My Party! assign keybinding - step 3"/>

## Control it by macro
Use the exposed `class PartyCruncher` - just like this, it's a no-brainer:

    PartyCruncher.group(<partyNumber); // Assigns the selected list of tokens to another party tokens identified by a name you type in
    PartyCruncher.toogle(<partyNumber); // toggles the specified party between a single "party token" (crunched) and separate "member tokens" (explode)
    PartyCruncher.find(<partyNumber); // autoselect the specified party in the scene, moving focus and canvas you to it

The module comes already bundled with a predefined set of 5 macros per action (for up to 5 configurable parties of tokens), recognizable by their icons:

## Adjustable module settings

## Recommended modules in combination with this one
- [Hot Pan & Zoom!](https://github.com/coffiarts/FoundryVTT-hot-pan) by coffiarts: Keeps your players' canvas position and zoom in sync with your GM screen, especially useful when toggling and finding groups 
- Use the following THREE mods together to pimp the whole thing to a new level!
  1. [Animated Assets (JB2A)](https://github.com/Jules-Bens-Aa/JB2A_DnD5e) (aka "JBA") by Jules&Ben
  2. [Automated Animations](https://github.com/otigon/automated-jb2a-animations) by otigon
  3. [Sequencer](https://github.com/fantasycalendar/FoundryVTT-Sequencer) by fantasycalendar<br/> 
  **Make sure that you're using ALL THREE of them in combination, otherwise it won't work!**<br/>
  This allows autoplaying of animations on toggling. A default animation from JB2A is already preconfigured in the settings, but can be changed to your liking.

Presence of these modules is optional! If installed, ***Crunch my Party!*** will automatically detect and handle them. Just lean back and enjoy.
However, note the additional options that derive from it: ...

### Notes on using Hot Pan and Zoom
If [Hot Pan & Zoom!](https://github.com/coffiarts/FoundryVTT-hot-pan) is installed and active, TOGGLE and FIND functions will, by default, make use of it: I.e. both the GM's and the player's views will be automatically panned and zoomed to the location of the related party.

If you do NOT want players' views to be synchronized (e.g. if you don't want them to see what you are doing), you can bypass Hot Pan & Zoom! with an additional macro parameter, like this:

    PartyCruncher.toggleParty(<partyNumber>, false); // false means: useHotPanIfAvailable = false (default is true)
    PartyCruncher.findParty(<partyNumber>, false); // false means: useHotPanIfAvailable = false (default is true)

### Notes on using JB2A - Automated Animations - Sequencer
Installing these 3 optional mods (strongly recommended!) will play atmospheric animations on crunch and explode. All 3 mods are used in combination (simply installing one or two of them won't work!).

You may choose to override the default animation with another one of your choice by adjusting the game setting **"Explode animation (optional)"**. See [Adjustable module settings](#adjustable-module-settings).

## Compatibility and Dependencies
- Tested on Foundry VTT 11.2xx and higher (including v12) in world system "dsa5" / "tde5" (The Dark Eye). But I consider it system-agnostic.
- No hard dependencies, but some warmly recommended *optional* 3rd-party modules are listed further above (see there to understand why I recommend them).

## Upcoming features
Things I am *considering* to do in the future (given proper demand for it - feedback welcome!):

- `small`: ~~Allow for missing tokens in the scene to make toggling more tolerant~~ => [RELEASED with v11.0.4](https://github.com/coffiarts/FoundryVTT-crunch-my-party/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#1104)
- `medium`: auto-generate the group icon's image from its member tokens by generating overlay images. I _assume_ by now that this _should_ be doable in a similar same way as I've managed to generate overlay icons in my [Lock The Sheets!](https://github.com/coffiarts/FoundryVTT-lock-the-sheets) module. But it will require some research and experimenting! => See [Feature Request #4](https://github.com/coffiarts/FoundryVTT-crunch-my-party/issues/4)
- `small` to `?`: find a robust solution for the token movement on EXPLODE, which is currently still potentially unreliable (tokens stacking onto each other erratically). If you're eager to contribute, feel free to have a look at the [related discussion on Discord](https://discord.com/channels/170995199584108546/722559135371231352/1080590427012485211).
