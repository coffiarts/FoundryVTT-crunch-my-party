The **major** version number in my modules (like "11") always reflects the
Foundry VTT **core** version it is compatible with (and recommended for).

## 11.0.8
### 2024-04-24 - Optimized JB2A compatibility by Syrious
- Thanks to a pull request provided by github member [Syrious](https://github.com/Syrious), JB2A animations now also work with the Patreon version of JB2A, not only with the free version. See [Pull Request #5](https://github.com/coffiarts/FoundryVTT-crunch-my-party/pull/5).

## 11.0.7
### 2024-04-02 - Keybinding support
- Adds optional keybindings for toggling and finding groups (gamemasters only).
- "Optional" means: There are no preassigned key combinations. Assign them to your liking in the game settings (or ignore it if you don't want to use it). My personal preference is **SHIFT + 1/2/3/4/5** for finding and **CTRL + SHIFT + 1/2/3/4/5** for toggling groups.

## 11.0.6
### 2023-12-22 - Bugfix for [issue #2](https://github.com/coffiarts/FoundryVTT-crunch-my-party/issues/2)
Fixes a [stupid little bug](https://github.com/coffiarts/FoundryVTT-crunch-my-party/issues/2) that has been in there since the beginning.<br/>
Whenever one was trying to crunch/explode a party in a scene that was only _viewed_, but not the _active_ scene, an incomprehensible error was thrown onto the screen.
<br/>Now you can use it safely both in active and viewed-only scenes.
<br/>Thanks to github user [cwlithgow](https://github.com/cwlithgow) for spotting this!

## 11.0.5
### 2023-12-19 - Hotfix for 11.0.4
- The newly introduced optimization for tolerating missing tokens on "crunch" could cause unintuitive error messages when the (still mandatory) group token was missing from the scene. Fixed now.

## 11.0.4
### 2023-12-19 - Fixing the "Floating tokens bug" plus minor enhancements
- Fixes a nasty bug which could (during toggling) sporadically cause tokens to float openly across the scene instead of being displaced, hidden & shown at once. This may have been game breaking whenever those tokens had sight! The code for the automated token displacement has been completely refactored, thanks to some very helpful guys on discord (honeybadger, mxzf and others). Extra credits given! 
- Toggling from separate tokens to the single party token (aka "crunching") now tolerates missing tokens (the party must go on, even of it isn't complete). I believe it to be more intuitive and easier to use that way.
- Optimization in settings menu: Audio files are now easily selectable by filepicker
- Various internal refactorings

## 11.0.3
### 2023-07-16 - Add missing (only recommended) dependency (Sequencer)
- If people are using my mod (as STRONGLY recommended) in combination with JB2A [Animated Assets](https://github.com/Jules-Bens-Aa/JB2A_DnD5e) and [Automated Animations](https://github.com/otigon/automated-jb2a-animations), then this won't work unless they're also using [Sequencer](https://github.com/fantasycalendar/FoundryVTT-Sequencer) by [fantasycalendar](https://github.com/fantasycalendar). Otherwise, my mod can't make use of the animations. Those three are commonly used together, but it may not be self-explaining.
  So even I (dull as I am) simply forgot to mention this in earlier versions. I added that missing recommended dependency now.
- Declared end of Foundry v10 backward-compatibility

## 11.0.2
### 2023-06-27 - Changelog & Readme optimization for Module Management+
- Refactored documentation so that it can be properly displayed & linked in-game by [Module Management+](https://github.com/mouse0270/module-credits),<br/>
  which is a veeeery helpful mod that I waaaaarmly recommend!


## 11.0.1
### 2023-06-05 - Compatibility info simplified
- Reduced verified compatibility to main version (11) of FoundryVTT (instead of specific patch version)<br/>
  This gets rid of unnecessary "incompatibility risk" flags with every new patch version.


## 11.0.0
### 2023-05-28 - Foundry 11 compatibility release
- Actually, nothing has changed, technically. It had already been compatible, and it is still backward-compatible with v10.<br/>
  <span style="color:green">
  From now on, major versions will always reflect the corresponding Foundry VTT major version<br/>
  (i.e. mod version 11.x.x => compatible with Foundry v11, and so on)
  </span><br/>
  Strictly speaking, this mod has already been compatible with v11 (and it is still backward-compatible with v10!), but I detected and fixed some weak points on the go:<br/>
  <li>
  <b>Bugfix: Improved handling of sound and animations and related mod dependencies</b><br/>
  For (optional) usage of animations, it doesn't suffice to use JB2A, but you also need to have the Automated Animations mod (see description further below).<br/>
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>Bugfix: Audio will now also play when JB2A and Automated Animations are <i>not</i> installed.</b><br/>
  For (optional) usage of animations, it doesn't suffice to use JB2A, but you also need to have the Automated Animations mod (see description further below).<br/>
  </li>
  <li>Various minor readme corrections</li>


## 1.1.0
### 2023-03-05 - First official release - Going out into the world!
